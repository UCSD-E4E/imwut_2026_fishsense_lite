-- Every stored laser calibration, with the object it was fitted from.
--
-- §4.3 claims the dive slate carries the same scale as the checkerboard, and
-- checks it on the laser baseline: the baseline is a property of the rig, so a
-- unit calibrated against both objects must report the same one either way.
-- That check needs the calibration OBJECT per fit, which no other export
-- carries -- `dive.calibration_target_id` is the only place it is recorded.
--
-- A refused calibration has no `laserextrinsics` row at all (the gate refuses
-- to persist rather than flagging), so this returns accepted fits only. That
-- is the intended cohort: the comparison is between calibrations the pipeline
-- would actually use.
--
-- The baseline is hypot(x, y) of `laser_position`; z is 0 by construction.
